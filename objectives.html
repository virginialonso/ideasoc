    <br>
    <h3 style="font-size:30px" class="centered">To give you hands-on business experience and engagement <br>with key developing economies</h3> 
    <br>
    <p>IDEA Soc’s core ideal is to run pioneering business projects, working with, for example, Chinese companies like the China Agricultural Bank or China Construction Bank, and European social entrepreneurs, which aim to address developmental issues on a microeconomic level. You can apply for a position in any of our 2-3 projects per year, as well as have a key say in what kind of project area you want to see addressed, working in a multi-disciplinary team and attaining serious business experience of a country like China: you will work within a Hadron-collider for ideas. 
    <p>Rapid-fire brainstorming sessions and workshops are run for the teams involved, once a week. 
    <p>Our first project is already gathering speed: we are attempting to set up a scholarship for a disadvantaged Chinese student, whose education suffered from the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake, to come and study at UCL. Positions are open!
    <br>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="font-size:30px" class="centered">To provide you with cutting-edge debate about what ‘emerging’ means.</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The ‘BRICS’ are redundant: IDEA Soc offers such critical ideas through our range of surgically-precise public lectures, discussion panels, and interactive talks between industry heads, leading academics and students, magnifying the future seed-beds of economic development.
    <br>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="font-size:30px" class="centered">To connect you the best companies in emerging markets with you</h3>
    <br>
    <p>We are the key channel for some of the best firms in the world, and particularly those native to countries like Brazil, India, China or Korea to recruit top-calibre students interested in emerging markets, from one of the highest-ranked universities in the world. As such:
    <p>Networking events complement our Talks, and will re-center, sharpen and enhance your career options and career-thinking, directing you towards a widening world of new opportunities in fields such as management, consultancy, entrepreneurialism and medicine, all over the globe.
    <p>These are augmented by Company presentations, and business luncheons and dinners, creating opportunities to bring together the Companies of the future with the path-makers of the next century, stimulating earnest dialogue and exchange amongst both.
  	<br><p>Are you a culture-miner? More interested in the cross-pollination of Chinese and Japanese Art, the gold-rich vistas of South-American history or the manifold wisdom of Eastern European writing? We also run such culturally-orientated talks, with particular interest in the transitions of such ‘emerging’ countries, whose cultures are nevertheless steeped in age. 
    <p>Use our society magazine to voice your thoughts on cultural transition, in our prized cultural section, or vocalise your economic opinions in our international development pages.
